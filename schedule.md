Assignments are listed *below the date they will be discussed in class*.

Better to aim for early and miss than to aim for on-time and be too late."><sup>[1]</sup></a>, so you can post to our <a href="{{site.repo_url}}/discussions">discussion forum</a>. Exercises and presentations are due each class meeting, unless otherwise specified, and given our early start time I recommend endeavoring to complete them *by 9pm the night before* at the latest.

You should in general also have access to all your work in class, so we can discuss and/or revise. Possible methods of access include [GitHub](https://github.com) (recommended), Pitt's [OneDrive](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/services/cloud-collaboration-box-and-onedrive) instance (next best thing), an external service like Dropbox, or flash drive.

### [Week 01: Mon, Aug 25](plans/week-01) – Digital + Studies {#week-01}

For next time: **Schedule a meeting with Ben** for some time next week (that isn't Monday) to talk about possible sources/objects for you to process and present on. See the [office hours](office) page for how to claim a slot or request an alternative if the usual slots won't work for you.

        * NB: this article was built using the now-deprecated Adobe Flash, so it no longer displays the interactive features that illustrated each of the principles. (You can still read a PDF description of what used to be there.) But it's still a more concise encapsulation than reading Manovich's <em>The Language of New Media</em>.

### [Week 03: Mon, Sep 08](plans/week-03) – Inquiry + Iteration {#week-03}

Continue working on your project, and take notes in your [Mindful Practice Journal](projects.md). After reading, please check the [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions) and add your thoughts.

To prepare for week 03:

* **install a plain-text editor** if you don't already have one (e.g. [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
* **create a GitHub account** if you don't already have one. Think about your username: it can, but need not, indicate your real name or match your other online profiles. (Pros and cons either way.)
* **install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) app** and any dependencies it recommends. (NB: This may take up to 20 minutes, so please don't wait until the morning of class.)
    - NB: If you get an error saying it's not an approved app, don't worry: it's safe. Instead of double-clicking to open the installer, right-click and choose "Open" to give yourself permission to open it anyway.

### [Week 05: Mon, Sep 23](plans/week-05) – Project presentations, iteration 1: Sources {#week-05}

For week 05, [prepare a 5-minute presentation](projects#presentations-and-peer-review) on your independent project, which we can view in class and discuss.<sup title="Everyone will turn in, and everyone will get (and give) written peer feedback, but realistically we only have time for about four presenters with full discussion.">\*</sup> If you want to time yourself, you can even post a recording; but **you must have some presentation file you can share or link to.**

For this iteration, you should be able to answer the following:

* What sources / objects are you working with? How are they stored?
* What questions do you have about these sources?
* What are your long-term goals in working with these sources?
* What are your next steps?

*Post your presentation files, along with a link to your developing public-facing project, to the [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions).*

NB: By "public-facing," I mean you should have at least a landing page introducing your project to new viewers, even if that landing page is just a README file or tab within a worksheet.

NB: _Bring your own dongle_, if you need one.

Optionally, schedule a meeting with Ben in [office hours](office) for early feedback as you build your presentation.



### [Week 06: Mon, Sep 29](plans/week-06) – Data + People {#week-06}

Continue working on your project, and take notes in your [Mindful Practice Journal](projects.md). After reading, please head to the [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions) and add your thoughts.

### [Week 12: Mon, Nov 10](plans/week-12) – Exploration + Inspiration {#week-12}

Continue working on your project, and take notes in your [Mindful Practice Journal](projects.md).

To prepare for week 12, search the internet for a respected public-facing digital project in your field or discipline. Do any of your field's organizations or conferences sponsor awards for digital work? If so, you might start there. If you're not sure, now's a good time to find out!

Of the projects you find, **choose** one that inspires you, and **present** it to the class for a community peer review. **Be ready to discuss** its sources, methods, and presentation choices, as well as the arguments it makes or questions it helps us investigate. What does the digital medium facilitate?

Post a link to your chosen project to the [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions).


### [Week 13: Mon, Nov 17](plans/week-13) – Project presentations, iteration 3: And...? {#week-13}

To prepare for week 13, [prepare a 5-minute presentation](projects#presentations-and-peer-review) on your independent project, which we can view in class and discuss.<sup title="Everyone will turn in, and everyone will get (and give) written peer feedback, but realistically we only have time for about four presenters with full discussion.">\*</sup> If you want to time yourself, you can even post a recording; but **you must have some presentation file you can share or link to.**

For this iteration, you should be able to *look back through your journal* to answer the following:

* What questions are you pursuing by processing your sources / objects? (Remind us or update us)
* What answers do you have so far, however tentative?
* What are your next steps to deepen your questions and answers?
* What have you learned about digital research in the process?

*Post your presentation files, along with a link to your developing public-facing project, to the [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions).*

NB: _Bring your own dongle_, if you need one.

Optionally, schedule a meeting with Ben in [office hours](office) for early feedback as you build your presentation.

<!-- <div class="alert alert-warning">NEW: Based on our conversation in week 11, all videos should be <strong>posted by Friday, Nov 14</strong> so we can all <strong>watch them before class.</strong> This should allow us to dive right into sayback and feedback during next week's class.</div> -->



### [Week 14: Mon, Nov 25](plans/week-14) – <strong>No Class: Thanksgiving Break</strong> (digesting) {#week-14}

<div class="panel panel-info alert alert-success">
    <div class="panel-body alert-body">
        <p>Before you leave for break:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>post feedback for your partners</strong> on their current project iteration as a reply to last week's discussion forum post</li>
            <li><strong>vote on the "people's choice" week</strong> for when we return</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>


Otherwise, continue working on your project, and take notes in your [Mindful Practice Journal](projects.md).




### [Week 15: Mon, Dec 01](plans/week-15) – TBD (the people's choice) {#week-15}

Continue working on your project, and take notes in your [Mindful Practice Journal](projects.md).

Whether there are readings, and what they are, depends on the results of the vote!

### [Week 16: Mon, Dec 08](plans/week-16) – Project presentations, iteration 4: Presented {#week-16}

In preparation for our final class, **prepare** a now-<strong>10-minute</strong> presentation on your independent project, which we can view in class and discuss. For this iteration, you should be able to _look back through your journal and your **public-facing project site**_ to answer the following:

* What materials (sources, processing steps, arguments) are you providing on your site?
* How have you prepared your materials for presentation to a public readership?
* When you look back at your initial goals, where have you ended up?
* What have you learned in the process that could apply to future projects?

Post your video to the [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions); in the same post, include a link to your (okay if it's still-developing) public-facing project, even if it's the same link as last time.

NB: _Bring your own dongle_, if you need one.

Optionally, schedule a meeting with Ben in [office hours](office) for early feedback as you build your presentation.


<div class="panel panel-info alert alert-info">
    <div class="panel-body alert-body">
        Final reflections are due by <strong>noon on Friday, December 12</strong>, so I can get grades in by Tuesday's deadline.
    </div>
</div>

Thanks for a great semester – and enjoy the break!


<div class="footnote-block" style="margin-top:3em;">

<p class="footnote"><a href="#ftnref1" id="ftn1">[1]</a> This early deadline is not my way of being mean; it's just that sometimes things will take longer than you expect, and I'd really like for you to be able to sleep, and for me to be able to look over your work in the morning before class. Those latter two things are the real priorities that the "night before" policy is meant to achieve. <a href="#ftnref1"><em>~jump back~</em></a></p>

<!-- <p class="footnote"><a href="#ftnref2" id="ftn2">[2]</a> If you're updating an existing project, I recommend doing this in a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches">new branch</a> of the old repository, instead. <a href="#ftnref2"><em>~jump back~</em></a></p> -->

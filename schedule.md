Assignments are listed (as HW) *on the day they are assigned*. Readings should be completed, if possible, <strong>by end-of-day Friday</strong><a href="#ftn1" class="ftnref" id="ftnref1" title="This early deadline is not my way of being mean; it's just that sometimes things will take longer than you expect, and I'd really like for you to be able to sleep, and for me to be able to look over your work in the morning before class. Those latter two things are the real priorities that the 'night before' policy is meant to achieve."><sup>[1]</sup></a>, so you can post to our <a href="{{site.repo_url}}/discussions">discussion forum</a>. Exercises and presentations are due the following class meeting, unless otherwise specified, and given our early start time I recommend endeavoring to complete them *by 9pm the night before* at the latest.

You should in general also have access to all your work in class, so we can discuss and/or revise. Possible methods of access include [GitHub](https://github.com) (recommended), Pitt's [OneDrive](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/services/cloud-collaboration-box-and-onedrive) instance (next best thing), an external service like Dropbox, or flash drive.

Meet Ben in [office hours](office) some time this week. Take notes in your [Mindful Practice Journal](projects.md).

To prepare for week 3:

* **install a plain-text editor** if you don't already have one (e.g. [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
* **create a GitHub account** if you don't already have one. Think about your username: it can, but need not, indicate your real name or match your other online profiles. (Pros and cons either way.)
* **install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) app** and any dependencies it recommends. (NB: This may take up to 20 minutes, so please don't wait until the morning of class.)
    - NB: If you get an error saying it's not an approved app, don't worry: it's safe. Instead of double-clicking to open the installer, right-click and choose "Open" to give yourself permission to open it anyway.

<h3 id="week-12"><a href='plans/week-12'>Week 12: Mon, Nov 11</a> – Data 3: Visualization and Analysis (the people's choice)</h3>

Continue working on your project, and take notes in your [Mindful Practice Journal](projects.md).

In preparation for week 13, [**pre-record** a 5-minute presentation](projects#presentations-and-peer-review) on your independent project, which we can view in class and discuss. For this iteration, you should be able to *look back through your journal* to answer the following:

* What questions are you pursuing by processing your sources / objects? (Remind us or update us)
* What answers do you have so far, however tentative?
* What are your next steps to deepen your questions and answers?
* What have you learned in the process?

Post your video to the [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions); in the same post, include a link to your developing public-facing project, even if it's the same link as last time. _NB: By the end of the term, you should have at least a landing page introducing your project to new viewers, even if that landing page is just a README file or tab within a worksheet._

<div class="alert alert-warning">NEW: Based on our conversation in week 11, all videos should be <strong>posted by Friday, Nov 15</strong> so we can all <strong>watch them before class.</strong> This should allow us to dive right into sayback and feedback during next week's class.</div>

Optionally, schedule a meeting with Ben in [office hours](office) for early feedback as you build your presentation and public-facing site.


<h3 id="week-13"><a href='plans/week-13'>Week 13: Mon, Nov 18</a> – Project presentations, iteration 3: And...?</h3>

Post **feedback for your partners** on their current project iteration as a reply to last week's discussion forum post.

Continue working on your project, and take notes in your [Mindful Practice Journal](projects.md).

See below for readings we'll discuss after the break.

Continue working on your project, and take notes in your [Mindful Practice Journal](projects.md).

In preparation for our final class, <del>pre-record</del>**prepare** a now-<strong>10-minute</strong> presentation on your independent project, which we can view in class and discuss. For this iteration, you should be able to _look back through your journal and your **public-facing project site**_ to answer the following:

* What materials (sources, processing steps, arguments) are you providing on your site?
* How have you prepared your materials for presentation to a public readership?
* When you look back at your initial goals, where have you ended up?
* What have you learned in the process that could apply to future projects?

Post your video to the [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions); in the same post, include a link to your still-developing public-facing project, even if it's the same link as last time.

NB: _bring your own dongle_, if you need one.

# Codebase for *Digital Studies and Methods: Seminar*
Files toward a Jekyll-based course website for an interdisciplinary graduate-level Seminar in Digital Studies and Methods, prepared by Ben Miller at the University of Pittsburgh.

Many other syllabi were consulted in the construction of this one, but an especially heavy debt goes to Alison Langmead.

NB: This is just source code! For the live site, with better formatting, please go to https://benmiller314.github.io/dsam2025fall.

Something changes when words are spoken aloud. 

You know this if you’ve ever had a message you thought was sincere misread as snarky, or if you’ve found yourself jerking back awake to pick up your sinking body as the lecturer drones on and on. On the page, those lecture notes, I’m sure, looked good. But for the ear? 

Something changes when words are spoken aloud, or when the words are set against the sound of music, or environmental cues that trigger an emotional response.

In this unit, you’ll revise a piece of writing that you’ve already completed, transforming it by casting it as sound. In the process, you’ll learn more about the digital tools available to you as a multimodal composer; you’ll discover resources and archives of materials to layer over and under the human voice, and you’ll reflect on the affordances of using the aural and gestural modes in conjunction with the linguistic.

As before, I’ll ask you to use GitHub to submit and track your progress, and to source and cite all assets ethically. I’ve posted a number of links to the Resources page of our WordPress site to help you find materials.

As for where to begin? An essay from a former class, perhaps: imagine your quotations really spoken by another person, or the music swelling as you land on your conclusion. Or take another piece you’ve written, whether poetry or prose, and give it voice.

I won’t be judging the artistic merits of the piece, but rather how the piece adheres to or surpasses the criteria we develop as a class.

A draft is due October 5th, And final projects – with reflections – Will be due October 17th.

Any questions? I’ll be listening.

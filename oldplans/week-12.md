## First half: Let's discuss! {#first-half}

I want to start with some discussion topics I had on the agenda for last week but didn't quite get to.

### Variable types vary

Not all data is numerical. Some (quite a bit, actually) is **categorical**:
* Discrete possible values, rather than infinite
* Usually, textual labels
* Often (but not always) mutually exclusive, distinct values – i.e. if an observation is in one category, it's not in another

Categorical variables may be **nominal** or **ordinal**:
* *Nominal* categories are essentially lists of independent *names*; they can be easily re-sorted or grouped in a variety of ways. Examples include neighborhoods, 311 request codes, or tree types.
* *Ordinal* categories have a meaningful *order*, and should be presented in that order. You wouldn't scramble days of the week or put "strongly agree" next to "strongly disagree" without passing through "neither agree nor disagree" first.
    - Important side note: you also can't take an average of a Likert scale, because the numbers 1–5 aren't really quantitative values; they're categorical (albeit ordinal) values. Ten people strongly agreeing and another ten strongly disagreeing doesn't 'average' to neutrality.

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <p><strong>Categorical variables are fundamentally <em>ways to filter or group your data.</em></strong></p>
    <p>You can <strong>filter to one value</strong> within a category (especially a nominal category) as a way of making an otherwise overwhelming dataset manageable: e.g. to look at just pothole requests, or just garbage collection, rather than all of the hundreds of types of requests in the 311 database.</p>
    <p>You can <strong>group by a category that contains multiple values</strong> to see how other variables change when aggregated within these groups: e.g. to see how tree counts vary by neighborhood, you first summarize the tree counts for each neighborhood value.</p>
    <p>By combining those approaches, you can zoom in on the questions that really matter &ndash; and the answers you're able to communicate.</p>
</div>


### Models, Principles, and Perspectives

Now on to this week's readings, on [mental models (and bugs)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-truthful-art/9780133440492/ch03.html) and how they relate to [core visualization principles](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-truthful-art/9780133440492/ch05.html); on the [non-neutrality of graphs and numbers](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/pitt-ebooks/detail.action?docID=6120950) (and figure titles); and on [how various graph types emphasize particular relationships](https://academy.datawrapper.de/).


What's coming up for you? Questions, comments, confusions, connections? Skim your notes and <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/dsam2024fall/discussions/9">discussion posts</a> and remind yourself what's in there.

Let's discuss! We can take notes at [bit.ly/dsam{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes](https://bit.ly/dsam{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes). If we get to grok-writing by around 10:15, that should give us enough time to share and break and still get some practice in.

Some keywords from the reading, should we need starting points:
* big dick data
* zombie data
* raw data
* data setting
* the truth continuum
* relative variable
* patternicity bug
* storytelling bug
* confirmation bug

<!--
<details><summary>And also some passages</summary>

    <details><summary>From Cairo 3, quoting Raj Kamal</summary>
    <blockquote>
        <p>We humans love exciting stories. We see a single event and we transform it into a general rule. We stereotype and generalize [...] It happens to me, to you, to all of us. Being aware of this mental bug is paramount for visualization designers, but we're generally oblivious to it, with dire consequences. In January 2014, infographics designer <strong>Raj Kamal</strong> wrote an article in which he explained his creative process:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>It’s the “message” that decides the presentation. The numbers, visual, or text or a combination of these are to only support the way of putting the message across. This also changes the way one conceptualizes a graphic. The thought starts with the message and then gets into putting other related information together to support it instead of starting with the data and thinking of what to make of it (...) The advantage of taking this route is also that you are not just restricted by topics or numbers or just presenting “news.” You can go a step further and air your “views,” too, to make a point.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Proceeding this way is a recipe for disaster, but it is one that is too common in the news industry. A managing editor comes up with a headline—“We’re going to show how raising the minimum wage increases unemployment”—and then asks her reporters to just look for data to support it. It is the flaw, I believe, behind Wired’s story about the death of Web browsers, discussed before.</p>
        <p>Storytelling can be a potent tool for communicating effectively, but it is dangerous if it blinds us toward evidence that should compel us to tweak or discard our models.</p>
        </blockquote>

### EXT: Why charts and tables, not just numbers and text?

Let's talk about [Anscombe's quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet)

One takeaway: data's shapes not only help readers get quickly to the overall story we want to tell, they also help <em>us</em> figure out what that story might be.


### Grok writing

<div class="alert alert-success">
    Spend some time putting marks on a page to help you think through, and consolidate for yourself, what we discussed today. What do you want to remember? What are you left wondering?
</div>

After a few minutes, I'll ask everyone to share one thing, to which the only response will be "thank you."



## Break (10 minutes)
I'm guessing we'll hit the break at around 10:35 or so. Try to be back for a 10:45 start, so we have a full hour to get hands-on.

## Second half: Let's practice! {#second-half}

### Writing to center

<div class="alert alert-success">
    <p>Let's begin with a little reflective writing. I won't collect this, but keep it somewhere you'll be able to find it later.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Think about your DSAM project. What's exciting about it? What keeps you coming back to it?</li>
        <li>Given the ways you've processed your source material, what <em>categories</em> are you working with? Do you have a sense yet of how evenly they divide your data? (If not, OpenRefine might help you figure it out.) Is there one category you'd like to zoom in on, or several you want to compare across?</li>
        <li>Given the ways you've divided your source material, what <em>correlations</em> do you predict you'll find? That is, what aspects of your sources do you think will grow or shrink in the same (or opposite) directions? Try to put it in a sentence, e.g. <em>Where I see more X, I expect to see more Y.</em></li>
    </ul>
</div>

### Options for studio

You have some options for hands-on time, depending on what you're working with and where you are in the process. Remember that the goal is to have some _claims_ to make and post in video form by this Friday!


1. We didn't finish with **OpenRefine** last week; if you have data that needs alignment or refinement, that might be a good place to begin.
    - This is an especially useful tool whenever you have multiple values that you want to split apart or combine.
    - With split values within a column, you can also facet, cluster, and edit to get more consistent tagging and more accurate counts within categories.
    - NB: when faceting, you can click on the choice count to show tab-separated values that you can copy and paste to Excel, Datawrapper, etc.

2. You might want to work through some **Datawrapper** tutorials, starting with their data. Some suggestions below!
    - NB: If you haven't already, I strongly advise practicing new tools with their sample data before you dive into your own. They provide data they know will go smoothly, so you can make a chart and modify it in under 10 minutes, and get a feel for how the tool works and what options it gives you. Setting up your own data could easily take 2 or 3 times longer, depending on how (dis)similar it is to their expected defaults.

3. You might forgo datavis today, despite the topic of the week, and just have **general studio time** to work on your own project – whatever step you're up to – in a dedicated co-working environment. You can also call me over with questions, especially if you're not able to make it to office hours.


#### Datavis starting points: tasks and tutorials

Suppose you wanted to...

<details><summary>Rank nominal categories</summary>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> find the top (or bottom) <em>N</em> categories by values (or counts) along one shared axis of comparison</p>

    <p><strong>Color strategy:</strong> use spot color to highlight one or two particular values of interest, and let the rest be a neutral gray; rainbows aren't helpful.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:&nbsp;</strong>Use horizontal bars when it makes the labels easier to read.</p>

    <p><strong>Description:</strong> compare selections where exact numbers matter less than ratios, or within an ordered range of values (e.g. from "strongly agree" through "strongly disagree")</p>
    <p><strong>Tool:</strong> <a href="https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/17-how-to-create-a-stacked-bar-chart">stacked bar chart</a></p>
    <p><strong>Color strategy:</strong> To show variation within a single line, it often makes sense to use one or two hues (e.g. blue or orange) and vary the saturation or lightness of that basic color; that usually means it'll still be distinguishable in black and white, but check.</p>

    <p><strong>Color strategy:</strong> If the subcategories are nominal, aim for a <a href="https://chartio.com/learn/charts/how-to-choose-colors-data-visualization/#qualitative-palette">qualitative color palette</a>, like <a href="https://waldyrious.net/viridis-palette-generator/">viridis</a>, that varies both the hue and the brightness/saturation; this will give your readers the best hope of distinguishing between categories.

    <p><strong>Color strategy:</strong> In a symbol map, color can encode a category while size encodes a quantitative value; use a categorical color scheme and keep the number of categories small (usually 5 or below). In a choropleth map, the same logic as in stacked bar graphs applies: if you're showing one continuous variable, use a single hue and vary the luminosity; if you're showing a divergent scale (e.g. agree/disagree, increase/decrease), use a divergent scale with a neutral gray or tan for the values in the middle.</p>

### EXT: Studio

Feeling good on all the above? Use the remaining time to work on your project.




## Homework for next time {#hw}

* As always, continue working on your project, and take notes in your [Mindful Practice Journal](projects.md).

* <strong>By this Friday, Nov 15</strong>, [**pre-record** a 5-minute presentation](projects#presentations-and-peer-review) on your independent project, so we can watch before class. For this iteration, you should be able to *look back through your journal* to answer the following:

    - What questions are you pursuing by processing your sources / objects? (Remind us or update us)
    - **NEW:** What answers do you have so far, however tentative?
    - What are your next steps to deepen your questions and answers?
    - What have you learned in the process?

* Post your video to the [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions); in the same post, **include a link** to your developing public-facing project, even if it's the same link as last time.
    - <div class="alert alert-warning">What does a "public-facing project" entail? As we discussed last week, by the end of the term you should have at least a <strong>landing page</strong> introducing your project to new viewers, even if that landing page is just a README file or tab within a worksheet.</div>

* **Watch all your classmates' videos before class.** This should allow us to dive right into sayback and feedback during next week's class.

EXT: Hungry for still more resources on data visualization? I just discovered this open-access textbook that looks quite promising: Dougherty, Jack, and Ilya Ilyankou. Hands-On Data Visualization. O’Reilly Media, 2021 (online version updated October 2024). [https://handsondataviz.org/](https://handsondataviz.org/).

Here's their abstract:
> Tell your story and show it with data, using free and easy-to-learn tools on the web. This introductory book teaches you how to design interactive charts and customized maps for your website, beginning with easy drag-and-drop tools, such as Google Sheets, Datawrapper, and Tableau Public. You will also gradually learn how to edit open-source code templates built with Chart.js, Highcharts, and Leaflet on GitHub. Follow along with the step-by-step tutorials, real-world examples, and online resources. This book is ideal for students, non-profit organizations, small business owners, local governments, journalists, academics, or anyone who wants to tell their story and show the data. No coding experience is required.

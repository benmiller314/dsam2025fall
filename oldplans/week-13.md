## Preamble: Workshop + peer review plan

Welcome back, and welcome to our third day of presentations! I'm excited to talk more about how it's been going, and especially about what insights or conclusions you're beginning to reach.

### An updated workshop cycle

1. We're skipping the presentation itself, so we'll start with someone else **"saying back"** the project: summarizing _the heart of what's new this time_, i.e. what answers are being put forward, and how the project's creator knows. Add a **...?** to the end.

2. The author can then **affirm or clarify**, reaching out into the almost-said to help us all understand how the project is working and what questions you still need help with.

3. We'll work together to **address questions** raised by the author or raise new ones – not, ideally, questions that go entirely beyond what's possible in the next few weeks, but rather questions that help steer the creator into greater clarity or productive uses of their time.

4. At each transition between projects, take some quick private **notes**: what do you want to remember for your own future projects or presentations? for your written peer review?

Above all, demonstrate your care and investment in each other's success, knowing that there's still more to do to get there. Together.

### Project order / review pairing
<div class="alert alert-warning">
Note the headers here: for in-class use, this table shows who will be <em>reviewing the speaker</em>, not whom the speaker is writing to. (I'll have another table for that later, in the homework section.)
</div>

In other words, this table is to help you know when to pay extra-close attention and ask the questions that will help you while you're writing at home.

## Homework for next time {#hw}
* Preliminaries
* [Writing: peer review](#hw-writing)
* [Reading: digital pedagogy](#hw-reading)

### Preliminaries
1. If you haven't yet posted a link to a public-facing deliverable, please do so ASAP: even if it's just the text of your presentation or a folder with a CSV dataset and a README file, that will be essential for your peer reviewers – and for your own later reflection.
    - I'd be happy to help you create a GitHub repo if you'd like it.

2. Alison Langmead (HAA, SCI) and Aaron Brenner (Pitt Libraries, Digital Scholarship Services), the co-teachers of the DSAM Practicum and Capstone, will be joining us at the start of class – please do your best to be here on time for a 9am start!

<div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>There is no class next week</strong> for the Thanksgiving holiday. As your energies allow, though, you may wish to continue logging time on your project – including in your Mindful Practice Journals.</div>

### Writing: peer review {#hw-writing}
There is some reading we'll discuss after the break; [see below](#hw-reading)! But first, the writing, which again is **peer review:** you'll each be responsible for **writing back to two of your classmates**. See below for a table of whose projects you're responding to.

<ol class="spaced">
    <li>Re-watch the video.</li>
    <li><strong>Have a look through the public-facing version of the project</strong>. What do you notice? What do you wonder? What does it make you think of?</li>
    <li>Be a genuine and generous audience. To help your partner see their work through your eyes, <strong>summarize back to them what you see them doing, trying to do, or <em>almost</em> doing.</strong> (That last is often a good place for the author to lean into.) Hopefully you'll be able to pick up from our in-class conversation, assuming we were able to keep in reasonable time.</li>
    <li><strong>Make connections and ask questions</strong>: this may include tools, materials, or scholarship you think would be useful to bring in; questions or clarifications about the process; strategies that helped with your own projects; and so on.</li>
    <li>NEW: Bear in mind that we have only a few weeks left this semester! Though ideally this is not the last you'll see of these projects, <strong>the most helpful feedback now will likely be practical</strong>, rather than theoretical or positing some data source beyond what your partner already has. Look for ways to help your partner achieve some closure, at least temporary closure, by the last day of class. Consider how the questions are framed, for example.</li>
</ol>

Remember, in those reviews, I'm NOT asking you to evaluate the success of the project; rather, I'm asking you to help synthesize some _formative feedback_, oriented toward next steps, assuming that everything is still a work in progress.

You may be wondering, "How am I supposed to offer feedback when I'm still figuring so much out myself?" In part, by being a genuine audience for your classmates: help your partners see how you've tried to engage with the project, where you got excited, where you got stuck or confused.

Above all, be generous. That doesn't mean only singing praises, though by all means do so when it feels genuine! You can be generously critical, as long as you're critically generous at the same time. Demonstrate your care and investment in each other's success, knowing that there's still more to do to get there. Together.

You can <strong>post these notes as replies to your partners' <a href="{{site.repo_url}}/discussions">discussion forum</a> posts</strong> containing the videos and links to projects.

        <li>from the abstract: "What would the assessment of digital writing look like if we began with conversations between writers and readers, students and teachers, children and adults? In this chapter, we report on the ways in which we’ve begun addressing that question, specifically by presenting five domains—context, artifact, substance, process management and technique, and habits of mind—that link the language of assessing multimodal writing with acts that drive the creation and reception of digital texts." I came pretty close to assigning this one.</li>

No required reading-response post this week, in light of the peer review, but I can put up an optional discussion forum just in case there's some note you want to put on our collective radar before we come in.

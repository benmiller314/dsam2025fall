I (Ben) know many of you have already signed up to meet in [office hours](../office) some time this week. I'll see you there! And if none of those times work, let's figure out something else by email.

## What to expect in those meetings

These first meetings are aimed not only at getting to know you a little better, but ideally to do so by **talking through possible digital projects for you to work on this semester.** That's why I chose the assignments I'd chosen for last week: they demonstrate a (partial) range of possible project formats, all of which neverthless can be productively framed as "sources, processed and presented" (in Posner's formulation), and all of which are (to borrow phrasing from Nick Montfort) "tractable, computational, and interesting."

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>To prep for the meeting, then, I encourage you to consider these questions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>What questions do you have within your larger research agenda? What sources might help you gather evidence in pursuit of responses to those questions?</li>
    <li>What sources do you have within your grasp? What larger research questions do you have that these sources might help you address?</li>
    <li>Were there any projects you saw that made you say, "Zomg I want to learn how to do <em>that</em>"?</li>
</ol>
</div>

And if you don't see this in time, we'll think through it on the spot. :¬)

From those starting points, we'll then look for ways to keep the project at a viable _scale_, which will mean asking Risam and Gil's minimal computing questions:

4. What do we need?
5. What do we have?
6. What must we prioritize?
7. What are we willing to give up?

Planning on a small-scale deliverable from the outset, and then adding stretch goals if they turn out to be easier than expected, is a good way to keep your morale up and your learning visible.


## For week 3

When we get back together on September 9th, I'd like to continue our conversation about what "digital" affords by thinking about reproduction, circulation, iteration, and difference detection. And we'll do it in the context of a slightly longer intro to GitHub than we achieved in lesson 1.

There's only one new **reading**, but there are also **downloads** that you should make sure to start early; if you run into trouble, I can help you troubleshoot during office hours.

I'll also ask you to **write** a post to [a new discussion forum in response to the readings](https://github.com/benmiller314/dsam2024fall/discussions/2), to give you a chance to think in writing about the readings and to seed our in-class conversation.


To prepare for week 3:

* **install a plain-text editor** if you don't already have one (e.g. [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
* **create a GitHub account** if you don't already have one.
    - Think about your username: it can, but need not, indicate your real name or match your other online profiles. (Pros and cons either way.)
* **install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) app** and any dependencies it recommends. (NB: This may take up to 20 minutes, so please don't wait until the morning of class.)
    - NB: If you get an error saying it's not an approved app from the app store, don't worry: it's safe! In this case, instead of double-clicking to open the installer, right-click and choose "Open" to give yourself permission to open it anyway.

and **read**:

* Stolley, Karl. “The Lo-Fi Manifesto, v 2.0.” Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy, vol. 20, no. 2, Jan. 2016, <a href="https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/inventio/stolley/">https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/inventio/stolley/</a>.
* EXT for eager readers:
    - Stolley's "[README for The Lo-Fi Manifesto, v 2.0](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/inventio/stolley/readme/)"
    - Stolley's notes on his earlier draft, "[Lo-Fi Manifesto, v 1.2](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/inventio/stolley/1.2)"


See you soon!

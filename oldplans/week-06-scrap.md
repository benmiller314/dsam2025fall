the following terms from this week’s readings and video, which I’ve chosen among the many possible because I think they’ll help us think across texts and contexts in a useful way:

* systematic
* tractable
* hierarchical
* visible
* actionable
* structured

What does putting together the sources' different uses of these terms help you notice? What does it lead you to wonder? Where might we go from there?


* AmyJo Brown, starting at [4:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fUKTPAvYDM&t=278s):

> After you are familiar with the data that you are using, and what you might be able to learn from it, start to write down the questions that you think it can answer for you. This will help focus your data entry effort.
>
> It can be awfully tempting to capture every piece of data on the form. But that will significantly increase the cost of the project in time and resources. (This is a hard-learned lesson.)
>
> At the same time, you don't want to get halfway through your data entry work and then realize there was a piece of data that you really wish you had to work with. So it helps to work backwards from the questions that you actually want to answer.


* Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein, page 8:

> Darden herself didn’t need any more evidence of the problem she faced; she was already living it every day. But when her experience was recorded as data and aggregated with others’ experiences, it could be used to challenge institutional systems of power and have far broader impact than on her career trajectory alone.
>
> In this way, Darden models what we call _data feminism_: a way of thinking about data, both their uses and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by intersectional feminist thought. The starting point for data feminism is something that goes mostly unacknowledged in data science: power is not distributed equally in the world.


* D'Ignazio and Klein, page 10:

> The process of converting life experience into data always necessarily entails a reduction of that experience—a long with the historical and conceptual burdens of the term. That Darden and Champine were able to view their work as a success despite these inherent constraints underscores even more the importance of listening to and learning from people whose lives and voices are behind the numbers. No dataset or analysis or visualization or model or algorithm is the result of one person working alone. Data feminism can help to remind us that before there are data, there are people—people ­ who offer up their experience to be counted and analyzed, people who perform that counting and analysis, people who visualize the data and promote the findings of any particular project, and people who use the product in the end. There are also, always, people who go uncounted—for ­ better or for worse. And there are problems that cannot be represented—or addressed—by data alone. And so data feminism, like justice, must remain both a goal and a process, one that guides our thoughts and our actions as we move forward toward our goal of remaking the world.

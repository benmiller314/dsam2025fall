## First half: Let's talk! {#first-half}

### Introductions
As was foretold, we have here to visit us today two digital pedagogues extraordinaire, Alison Langmead and Aaron Brenner. Welcome! They'll be talking about [DSAM 3100: Practicum](https://www.dsam.pitt.edu/dsam-practicum), the next course in the sequence of required cores for the [DSAM Certificate](https://www.dsam.pitt.edu/requirements).

<div class="alert alert-success">
As everyone files in, though, I thought we might briefly go around saying just a few words about who we are and what we're working on.
</div>

I can start: I'm Ben Miller; I'm a tenth-year faculty member in the English department's Composition program. For my current project, I'm looking at metadata from dissertations in my field over about 25 years to learn more about the relationship among research methods, committee membership, and hiring patterns.

Shall we just go around the circle?

### DSAM Practicum

Take it away, Aaron and Alison!

### Warm-up writing

To help us shift back into today's topic and the readings from over the break, let's take a few minutes gathering our thoughts on the page:

* What challenges did you expect digital pedagogy to involve?
* What challenges did these _authors_ expect it to involve?
* What (else) surprised, delighted, or confused you?
<!-- * Based on what you've read, what approaches would you want to try in your own classrooms? -->

### Discussion

We can take notes in the <a href="https://bit.ly/dsam{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes">shared google doc</a>.

### Grok writing

<div class="alert alert-success">
    Before we break, spend some time writing to think through, and consolidate for yourself, what we discussed today. What do you want to remember? What are you left wondering?
</div>

After a few minutes, I'll ask everyone to share one thing, to which the only response will be "thank you."


## Break (10 minutes)
I'm guessing we'll hit the break at around 10:45 or so. Try to be back for a 10:55 start, so we have as much time to get hands-on as possible.

## Second half: Let's practice! {#second-half}

From about five minutes from now until the last five minutes of class, you have **general studio time** to work on your own project – whatever step you're up to – in a dedicated co-working environment. You can also call me over with questions, especially if you're not able to make it to office hours.

### Set an intention

Those first five minutes, though? Please **set some goals**:

<div class="alert alert-success">
In our <a href="https://bit.ly/dsam{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes">shared google doc</a>, write up to 2 sentences declaring your intentions: Given what you hope to achieve by the end of the term, what small piece of your project do you hope to tackle in the next 30-40 minutes?</div>

**EXT: Inspiration**

Feeling like you can't make more progress on your project? This might be a good time to look at the [examples from past years](../sample-projects).


### Get to it

### Exit note

When the end of the class is approaching, **please head back into the google doc** and respond to your own note from earlier:

* How far did you get?
* What are your new priorities for the coming week?



## Homework for next time {#hw}

* As always, continue working on your project, and take notes in your [Mindful Practice Journal](projects.md).

* Optionally, schedule a meeting with Ben in [office hours](office) for early feedback as you build your presentation and public-facing site.

* In preparation for our final class, **prepare a now-10-minute presentation** on your independent project, **focused now on the public-facing site** and the choices you've made. For this fourth iteration, you should be able to _look back through your journal and your project site_ to answer the following:
    * What materials (sources, processing steps, arguments) are you providing on your site?
    * How have you prepared your materials for presentation to a public readership?
    * When you look back at your initial goals, where have you ended up?
    * What have you learned in the process that could apply to future projects?

<div class="alert alert-info">What does a "public-facing project" entail? As we discussed before the break, you should have at least a <strong>landing page</strong> introducing your project to new viewers, even if that landing page is just a README file or tab within a worksheet. Think about your audience, and what they would need to understand what you're providing them.</div>

* I'm willing to make the video optional this time, but **I do want you to prepare a visual/navigational aid** you can share (a slide deck, Prezi, walkthrough, or, yeah, screencast). This will...
    - help you stay organized, and thus leave time for everyone to present
    - help you think concretely about what your site looks like / how users will navigate it
    - preserve a record of how your site worked at this time (presuming you'll keep working on it)

* Post your presentation to the [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions); in the same post, **include a link** to your developing public-facing project, even if it's the same link as last time.

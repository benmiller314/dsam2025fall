<a id="first-half"></a>
## Getting to know GitHub

### Exigence (~5 min)
<!-- I'd like to continue our conversation about what "digital" affords by thinking about reproduction, circulation, iteration, and difference detection. And we'll do it in the context of a slightly longer intro to GitHub than we achieved in [week 1](week-01).
 -->
In his [manifesto](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/inventio/stolley/#manifesto), Karl Stolley elevates Version Control to a key principle for digital production: "Always. Everywhere. For everything."

So: what _is_ version control?

And what does it have to do with what we discussed [last time we met](week-01#part-2-digital), about the affordances or properties of digital media?

Let's try to use the shared notes doc where we can: [bit.ly/dsam{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes](https://bit.ly/dsam{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.l3atecaufpnh).

<aside class="alert alert-info">Side note: <em>exigence</em>, i.e. why we're talking about what we're talking about, is one element of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rhetorical_situation_triangle.jpeg">rhetorical situation</a>: a way of theorizing what writers and speakers consider in deciding what to say or write.</aside>

### Affordances (~10-15 min)

<div class="alert alert-success">
Let's check out the GitHub.com web interface, and see how it works: come with me to
<strong><a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/text-demo">https://github.com/benmiller314/text-demo</a></strong>
</div>

Initial questions to ask of any app:

- How is the space laid out?
- What's given the most prominent visual focus? Secondary focus?
- What features/tools do you have quick access to?

In other words: what functions or actions are _afforded_ by this interface? What does it seem to expect you to be looking for? What does it seem to expect you to do?

Key terms to understand from this section:

* repository / repo
* README
* .md
* affordance


### Version control in action (~20-25 min)

Following along in the same text-demo repo, let's make some changes – first online, and then offline with GitHub Desktop and a text editor.

Key terms to understand from this section:

* commit
* commit message
* hash
* diff
* clone
* pull
* push
* EXT:
    - pull request
    - branch

EXT: If we're okay on time (if it's before, say, 9:45), I'd love to decompress a .docx file to show you why it's not as simple as it may seem.

### Your turn (~20-25 min)

Now that you've seen me do it, it's your turn to try! There's a new repository with instructions: <a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/dsam-gh-practice">github.com/benmiller314/dsam-gh-practice</a>.

In addition to practicing with GitHub, I have a little writing prompt to help us continue thinking about what changes when "digital" gets involved.

<div class="alert alert-success">
After reading through the README, the first step will be to <strong>fork</strong> the repo. Then you can clone it, write and edit locally, and push your changes back up to the cloud.
</div>

**NB:** For this exercise you can work alone or in pairs.

### Debrief

Let's aim to come back together at around 10:10 or so.

How did it go? Any tips, tricks, or reminders you want to get in the [notes doc](https://bit.ly/dsam{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.l3atecaufpnh)?


## Break (10 min)
Assuming we left off at 10:20, let's aim to start up again at 10:30. That should beat the elevator rush for 11am classes while still giving us a good hour to discuss the readings.

## Second half: Learning, Openness, Flexibility, Iteration

Only two posts to the discussion board this week by the time I went to bed! I know it was weird with Labor Day, and we're just getting started, but I do hope you'll agree with me that getting some thoughts in writing is a good way to (a) preserve an impression of what you were thinking before class, which can (b) help you reflect on what you've learned when you look back at it from the end of the semester or certificate program. Not only that, but writing is also (c) a good way to *figure out* what you're thinking in response to these readings.

To be clear, you don't need to express *everything* you're thinking! This is meant to be low stakes. Pick one thing, and unpack it for a paragraph or two. What stood out to you? What does it make you wonder?

### Starting points

<details id="ease-and-expertise"><summary>Ease and expertise</summary>
    <p>Stolley writes:<blockquote>Software and communications technologies that elevate ease over expertise are the culprits here. Those who teach have an even more pressing responsibility to learn and then engage students with digital approaches and technologies that students themselves would not likely discover independently....The richest learning experiences reveal how failure and crude initial work transform to something better only through ongoing research and revision.</blockquote></p>

    <p>Jiating responds:<blockquote>I think the ease of technologies is crucial, especially for someone who does not have much digital experience. Simplified tools allow them to focus on what they truly need and help them to become more efficient. Besides, I think the one of the key directions of technological development is to make complex technologies easier to use for everyone.</blockquote></p>

    <ul><li>Stolley does call this a "manifesto," so he probably knows he's being a bit hyperbolic. How might we think about the balance between the value he sees in engaging with difficulty and the value Jiating sees in offering on-ramps for wider participation?</li><li>Are ease and expertise (always/sometimes/never) opposed?</li><li>Does anything you experienced in the first half of today's class help you test or probe that balancing act?</li></ul>
</details> <!-- /ease and expertise -->

<details id="free-as-in"><summary>Free as in...</summary>
    <p>Stolley writes:<blockquote>Lo-fi production technologies are stable and free: sometimes free as in beer; sometimes free as in speech; and sometimes, if not chosen only after careful research, <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/1678/" title="I know it's broken. It wasn't originally.">free as in puppy</a>.</blockquote></p>
    <p>Nick notes:<blockquote>Not a question really, but I think the fact that this link is dead adds something to this article. Maybe it's just me, though.</blockquote></p>
    <ul><li>Can we unpack these metaphors, especially for those who haven't encountered them before?</li><li>What's the role of research and stability here?</li></ul>
</details> <!-- /free as in... -->

<details id="to-database-or-not"><summary>To database or not to database</summary>
    <p>Stolley writes:<blockquote><p>Ask someone why they chose a particular technology for a project, and you will often find one little feature driving the decision. It’s astounding, for example, to discover that people choose to set up WordPress to run a small website simply because they wanted a way to repeat the navigation across the four or five pages that made up the site. For that one feature, they pay the tax of securing a database connection and applying software updates for the life of the project [...]</p><p>A database might be lo-fi on its surface, but <strong>a database is best employed only under one of two conditions, usually both</strong>: first, there must be far more records than can be reasonably handled by flat files (that is, a database record per page of a website, rather than an HTML file per page). Second, database-like things must routinely be done to those records: sorting, counting, joining, and so on, in the context of more read–write operations than can be handled by flat files. <strong>A five-page website that’s infrequently updated does not fit that bill.</strong> (emphasis added)</p></blockquote></p>
    <p>This feels important to flag as you start to imagine what your <a href="../projects#palimpsest-of-public-iteration">public-facing project deliverables</a> will look like, through the several iterations you'll build this term. Some of you are, indeed, planning to do database-like things! But if you only have a handful of objects or arguments, rather than a big spreadsheet's worth of data, maybe standard HTML is enough – and well worth learning in the context of a class like DSAM.</p>
    <p>(Even if you haven't done it before, I bet I can get you up and running in about 2-3 weeks with tutorials like <a href="https://internetingishard.netlify.app/">Interneting is Hard (but it doesn't have to be)</a> and <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/">CSS Diner</a>. And after all, to quote Stolley again, "to learn any one markup language is to learn <em>about</em> the general idea of markup languages," making it easier to learn others later on.)</p>
</details> <!-- /to database or not -->

### What else?

I'm open to other ideas, questions, and curiosities!

Let's just save at least 15 minutes to write  and share notes, plus an extra five for me to introduce the homework. So let's say we'll end discussion by 11:30.

### Grok-writing

<div class="alert alert-success">
    <p>Spend some time putting marks on a page to help you think through, and consolidate for yourself, what we discussed today. What do you want to remember? What are you left wondering?</p>
</div>

After a few minutes, I'll ask everyone to share one thing, to which the only response will be "thank you."



## For week 4

In additions to the readings below and your own ongoing [Mindful Practice Journals](../projects#mindful-practice-journals) as you begin work on your semester-long projects, I'll also ask you to **write** a brief post to the [discussion forum](https://github.com/benmiller314/dsam{{site.course.slugterm}}/discussions/), to give you a chance to think in writing about the readings and to seed our in-class conversation.

But first, please **read** <span title="It may look like a lot, but without EXTs it's the equivalent of only about 72 pages. EXTs push that up to 118.">the following</span>.

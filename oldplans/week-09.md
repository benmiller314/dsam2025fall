## Preamble: Workshop + peer review plan

Welcome back, and welcome to our second day of presentations! I'm excited to hear more about how it's been going, and especially for you all to hear how it's been going for everyone else.

### A workshop cycle

Here's how I'd like it to work. Like last time, each person's project will get about 25 minutes:

1. The first five minutes will be the **presentation** you've pre-recorded.
2. From there, the rest of us start by **saying back** the heart of the project, with a **...?** at the end, opening a space for the presenter to say more.
    - This kind of _active listening_ can often get us to the edge of our current thinking, testing out the almost-said implications of what feels right and what feels off. I can start us off after the first presentation, to demonstrate what I mean.
3. That should set up a more organic back-and-forth **conversation** about the project. Anything is fair game here: tools, materials, or scholarship you think would be useful to bring in; questions or clarifications about the process (including questions about sources, processing, or presentation platforms); comparisons with your own projects; etc.
4. At each transition between projects, take some quick private **notes**: what do you want to remember for your own future projects or presentations? for your written peer review?

Above all, be generous. That doesn't mean only singing praises, though by all means do so when it feels genuine! You can be generously critical, as long as you're critically generous at the same time. Demonstrate your care and investment in each other's success, knowing that there's still more to do to get there. Together.

I've split presentations in two halves again, starting with those who didn't get in-class feedback last time. Again, peer reviews crossing from one part of class to the other, so you can pay extra attention to your assigned partner without having to worry that your own presentation is imminent.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Note the change in the headers here: for in-class use, this table shows who will be <em>reviewing the speaker</em>, not whom the speaker is writing to. (I'll have another table for that later, in the homework section.)
</div>

<!-- In other words, this table is to help you know when to pay extra-close attention and ask the questions that will help you while you're writing at home. -->

<a id="first-half"></a>
## Presentations: first half

1. Brenda
2. Yi

EXT: Kimmy

<div class="alert alert-info">
That process, again: (1) presentation, (2) saying back…?, (3)&nbsp;conversation, (4)&nbsp;quick notes (while the next person sets up).
</div>

I'm expecting 20-25 minutes each.

## Break (10 minutes)
We should hit the break at around 10:20 today.

<a id="second-half"></a>
## Presentations: second half

<ol start="3">
    <li>Cody</li>
    <li>Jiating</li>
</ol>

EXT: Cate

<div class="alert alert-info">
That process, one more time: (1) presentation, (2) saying back…?, (3)&nbsp;conversation, (4)&nbsp;writing notes (while the next person sets up).
</div>



<a id="peer-review"></a>
## The People's Choice votes {#survey-results}

If time allows, I'd like to share the results of the voting. My priorities in parsing the votes were:

<ol class="lalpha">
<li>To avoid options with a "1 (please no)" response</li>
<li>To prioritize remaining options with the highest median</li>
<li>To break ties by maximizing "5 (100 times yes)" responses.</li>
</ol>

By that algorithm, the top vote-getters (with 7 of 8 students voting) were:

1. Multimodal pedagogy and assessment
2. Data: Exploration and slicing
3. Data: Visualization and analysis

However, given the schedule and timing of iteration 3 and Thanksgiving break, with two back-to-back choice weeks before and one solo week after, I'm inclined to arrange the coming weeks as follows:

Week | Date | Lesson Title
--- | --- | ---
10 | Mon, Oct 28 | Digital accessibility <!-- Structured content and navigability. Font sizes and color. Alternative presentations. Spring enrollment begins. -->
11 | Mon, Nov 04 | _PC1: Data: exploration and slicing_ <!-- "family weekend" Friday 11/8 – Sun 11/10-->
12 | Mon, Nov 11 | _PC2: Data: visualization and analysis_
13 | Mon, Nov 18 | Iteration 3: And...? <!-- making an argument -->
14 | Mon, Nov 25 | **No class: Thanksgiving Break** (digesting)
15 | Mon, Dec 02 | _PC3: Multimodal pedagogy and assessment_
16 | Mon, Dec 09 | Iteration 4: Presented <!-- facing the public -->
{: .table .table-sm}

Unless... See, I hadn't given the option of spreading Iteration 3 over two weeks as a way to fit more feedback in. Iteration 4 (Presented) is our last class, and our last chance to hear from everyone – it would be great to have *everyone* present that day! But at our current rate, that would mean that half the class would get to present twice, while half would only get to present once. Should we try to fix that?

Let's discuss, as time allows!

**In any event:** Stay tuned for updates to readings on the main schedule page!



## Homework for next time {#hw}

* [Writing: peer review](#hw-writing)
* [Reading: digital accessibility](#hw-reading)

### Preliminaries
* If you haven't yet posted a link to a public-facing deliverable, please do so ASAP: even if it's just the text of your presentation or a folder with a CSV dataset and a README file, that will be essential for your peer reviewers – and for your own later reflection.
    - I'd be happy to help you create a GitHub repo if you'd like it.
* Conversely, if you haven't yet posted a video, please do! If it's short enough you should be able to just drag the .mp4 or similar file into the editing box of a new post. If you're down to 5 minutes but it's getting bounced for size, you can share a link to your file on OneDrive.


### Writing: peer review {#hw-writing}
There is some reading this week; [see below](#hw-reading)! But first, the writing, which again is **peer review:** you'll each be responsible for **writing back to two of your classmates**. See below for a table of whose projects you're responding to.

<ol class="spaced">
    <li>Watch the video (or revisit it, even if you've seen it in class).</li>
    <li><strong>Have a look through the public-facing version of the project</strong>. What do you notice? What do you wonder? What does it make you think of?</li>
    <li>Be a genuine and generous audience. To help your partner see their work through your eyes, <strong>summarize back to them what you see them doing, trying to do, or <em>almost</em> doing.</strong> (That last is often a good place for the author to lean into.)</li>
    <li><strong>Make connections and ask questions</strong>: as in my suggestions for conversation above, this may include tools, materials, or scholarship you think would be useful to bring in; questions or clarifications about the process; comparisons with your own projects; and so on.</li>
</ol>

Remember, in those reviews, I'm NOT asking you to evaluate the success of the project; rather, I'm asking you to help synthesize some _formative feedback_, oriented toward next steps, assuming that everything is still a work in progress.

You may be wondering, "How am I supposed to offer feedback when I'm still figuring so much out myself?" In part, by being a genuine audience for your classmates: help your partners see how you've tried to engage with the project.

Above all, be generous. That doesn't mean only singing praises, though by all means do so when it feels genuine! You can be generously critical, as long as you're critically generous at the same time. Demonstrate your care and investment in each other's success, knowing that there's still more to do to get there. Together.

You can <strong>post these notes as replies to your partners' <a href="{{site.repo_url}}/discussions">discussion forum</a> posts</strong> containing the videos and links to projects.

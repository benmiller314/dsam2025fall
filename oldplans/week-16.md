## How to assess a semester?

We've done a fair amount of reflective writing this semester: in-class warm-ups and grok-writing, Mindful Practice Journals, discussion board posts and mid-process presentations.

Here at the end of the term, I'm asking you to _go back through it and see what it teaches you to read it all in one fell swoop_. And then to name what that process – like the process of moving through this whole course – has helped you learn.

<div class="alert alert-success">
Your final assignment is a <strong>reflective letter to me and your own future self</strong>, both articulating – perhaps discovering – your learning in the class, and illustrating what you've learned with reference to <em>features of your products or your processes</em>.
</div>

The goal here is less a restatement of what you’ve already written than an opportunity to think synthetically, across iterations and into the future. In particular, I'll be curious to hear:

1. What **methods and workflows** have worked for you (perhaps as compared to those that have not)? What were the challenges and the joys that keep you moving through them?

2. What surprised you, or what **surprises** you now as you look back? e.g. What things did you learn that you did not expect to learn, or not learn that you had expected to? What realizations or questions do those surprises point you toward?

3. What **feedback** has been most helpful to you, and how did you receive it? What have you done as a result of that feedback? Did *giving* feedback help you as well? In what ways?

4. Thinking about the **digital tools and digital objects** of study you encountered this semester, are there any you want to explore further? What are your plans for doing so?

5. Finally, what evidence of **engagement with the course as a community** can you share that isn't covered by the above? You might, for example, point to successes in the recurring seminar activities from the syllabus / [policies page](../policies) (reprinted below for convenience).

<details><summary>You can be confident that you are successfully working through this seminar by...</summary>
<ul>
 <li>Contributing respectfully to our weekly topical conversations, whether in class or online.<ul>
    <li>Consider: <em>What is the purpose of seminar conversation? How do we learn from it? How do we balance speaking up, sitting back, branching out, and listening in, to produce the most effective learning environment for ourselves and others?</em></li></ul>
</li>
 <li>Completing the project iterations as described in the course plan, and on the schedule recommended.<ul>
     <li>Consider: <em>Why is iteration important? Why is the schedule important? How can I be not answering my question and nevertheless succeeding in the context of this seminar?</em></li></ul>
 </li>
 <li>Offering a content-rich, web-based palimpsest that you are proud to share with others.<ul>
     <li>Consider: <em>Why pride? Why do we share our findings publicly at this point in our (different) careers?</em></li></ul>
 </li>
 <li>Offering cogent and professional presentations that stay within the requested time limit.<ul>
     <li>Consider: <em>Why is presentation to peers important? Why is the time limit important?</em></li></ul>
 </li>
 <li>Writing two peer evaluations after each iteration is due, reflecting back what you notice and what you wonder about your peers' projects.<ul>
     <li>Consider: <em>Why are these evaluations requested on top of in-class discussion? How can I help someone else improve when I am still so unsure of what I am doing? How can evaluating someone else's work help me improve?</em></li></ul>
 </li>
 <li>Working at least 2-4 hours on your project every week, and documenting this effort in your Mindful Practice Journal.<ul>
     <li>Consider: <em>Why is consistency important? Why is documentation important? Why is so much self-reflection a part of this seminar?</em></li></ul>
 </li>
</ul>
</details>

## How will these be evaluated?

As requested, I'd like to think through this prompt in terms of baseline and aspirational forms of response (drawing on [Reilly and Atkins](https://ccdigitalpress.org/dwae/04_reilly.html)).

I've put a first draft in our [shared notes doc](https://bit.ly/dsam{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes?tab=t.0#heading=h.lm0zu74zgx11), but there's room for discussion and revision.

<div class="alert alert-success">
Please split into two groups to talk through the options. What works for you? Especially, what <em>doesn't</em> work for you as a baseline requirement? What other ideas do you have for ways to amaze? <strong>Use "suggesting" mode to propose edits, or add comments in the margins with questions.</strong></div>

EXT: If your group is finished, first loop back to see if there are any new comments or suggestions to respond to.

EXT: If you find yourself waiting for the other group, I recommend using the time to take notes toward your own reflective letter.


## About OMETs – and some time to fill them out

OMETs are a pretty important way of getting your voices heard; they can also have some pretty outsized effects on your teachers&rsquo; lives.

<details>
    <summary>Details.</summary>
    <p>I know some of you have already turned in your surveys for the Office of Measurement and Evaluation of Teaching (yep, that's what OMET stands for). If so, you can feel free to work on your own projects, though I hope what I'm about to say is still useful information. Actually, I hope you all know this stuff already, but my experience has been otherwise, so I try to say it in every class:</p>
    <div class="alert alert-info" style="color: #006eb3ff;">These evaluations of teaching serve multiple purposes, and go to multiple audiences:
        <ul>
            <li>They go to the program director or department chair, to help determine if I should keep teaching this course;</li>
            <li>they'll become part of my portfolio application for promotion, read by other faculty inside and outside my department;</li>
            <li>and, after grades are turned in, they'll go to me, so I can use them to revise and update the course. For that purpose, I especially value the free responses. (I've also added a few Likert questions that are particular to this course.)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>The same is true for all your instructors. For professors without tenure, OMET reviews may make the difference in whether they get to stay at Pitt. So the OMETs are, as I said above, a pretty important way of getting your voices heard, which is a good thing; on the other hand, they can also powerfully affect hiring, especially for women, immigrants, and people of color.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-success" style="color: #008013ff;">If you haven't yet filled out your survey, please do so now. You should have a link to the survey on Canvas, or in your Pitt email.</div>
    <p>I'll leave the room and monitor the response rates, but no matter what we'll have to start presentations by around 10:10 to make sure we have time for everyone. If you're not done by around 10, save your responses to complete later today.</p>
</details>
<p>In brief: please do fill these out, but <strong>please do your best to be fair, to be thoughtful, and to be considerate of how things like race, gender, and linguistic difference might color your responses.</strong> Implicit biases can often (if not always) be countered by bringing them to consciousness.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <p style="color: #006eb3ff;">EXT: If you've finished that anonymous survey, I'd be grateful if you'd also take my <em>non</em>-anonymous two-question survey: would you grant me <strong><a title="Permission to Teach with Your Work?" href="https://bit.ly/dsam-sharing" data-api-endpoint="https://bit.ly/dsam-sharing">permission to teach with your work</a></strong> in future iterations of this class?</p>
</div>

## Break (10 minutes)

Let's make sure we're back by 10:10 to start presentations! With eight projects and a celebratory (rather than advisory) role from the rest of us, I'm hoping we can get through in an hour and a half. But it's likely to be tight.

## Final (for this course) Project Presentations

If we're following the existing rotation, this would be the order of operations:

1. Jiating
2. Cody
3. Yi
4. Brenda
5. Cate
6. Nick
7. Kimmy
8. Gissell

I'll switch seats and keep track of time!


## An end is a beginning {#hw}

I still can't quite believe it's already our final class meeting! And very nearly the end of that, too.

But it is *not quite* the end of the semester: you still have one more week to reflect on your learning in the class, and add any final-for-now polish to the public-facing homes of your projects. I fully believe you should be proud of what you've accomplished, even if it wasn't exactly what you set out to achieve at the beginning.

Nor is it the end of DSAM, if you don't want it to be: you are all invited to register for DSAM 3100: Practicum, if you haven't yet. (Who's already signed up?)

And my [office hours](../office) are still open to you, whenever you need them. (I'll update the hours semester by semester, but the same link should work.)

<div class="alert alert-info">
So we'll be in touch, but let me say here while we're all still gathered together: It's been a pleasure getting to know you and to work and think with you this semester. Please don't hesitate to reach out to continue that process! Thank you all!
</div>

### Final assignment / where to turn in

On the final [discussion forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions) for the semester, please **post** the following by Monday, December 16 at noon:

1. A link to the final-for-now version of your **public-facing project**
    - Where relevant and possible, please _give credit to sources_ you used within your public-facing site, e.g. by linking back to source pages or by having a page within the project with bibliographic information (title, author, location, license).
    - Note that you should probably also _credit yourself_! (Unless there's a reason that anonymity is essential for safety – and there might be.) If your name and a brief bio do not yet exist on your public-facing site, consider: you use information about site creators to gauge your own trust-levels, right? How will you help others trust your own credentials?
2. If relevant, a link to a separate **repository** of source materials that you have been shaping or processing to produce your project.
    - NB: Both GitHub or OneDrive offer functionality to share a folder, either publicly or with specific people. If you have a repo and aren't sure how to share it, I can help.
3. As much of your end-of-semester **reflection** (see above) as you're willing to share publicly

<div class="alert alert-warning">
NB: If you do not feel comfortable sharing the repo or reflection with the public, please submit them instead by email.
</div>

Thank you for a great semester!!

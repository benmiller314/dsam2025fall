I (Ben) know many of you have already signed up to meet in [office hours](../office) some time this week – I'll see you there! – and some I've already seen. But if none of those times work, let's work out something else by email.

## What to expect in those meetings

These first meetings are aimed not only at getting to know you a little better, but ideally to do so by **talking through possible digital projects for you to work on this semester.** That's why I chose the reading & viewing assignments I'd chosen after week 01: they demonstrate a (partial) range of possible project formats, all of which neverthless can be productively framed as *"sources, processed and presented"* (in Posner's formulation), and all of which are (to borrow phrasing from Nick Montfort) *"tractable, computational, and interesting."*

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>To prep for the meeting, then, I encourage you to consider these questions:</p>

<ol class="spaced">
    <li>What questions do you have within your larger research agenda? What sources might help you gather evidence in pursuit of responses to those questions?</li>
    <li>What sources do you have within your grasp? What larger research questions do you have that these sources might help you address?</li>
    <li>Were there any projects you saw that made you say, "Zomg I want to learn how to do <em>that</em>"?</li>
</ol>
</div>

And if you don't see this in time, we'll think through it on the spot. :¬)

From those starting points, we'll then look for ways to keep the project at a viable _scale_, which will mean asking Risam and Gil's minimal computing questions:

4. What do we need?
5. What do we have?
6. What must we prioritize?
7. What are we willing to give up?

Planning on a small-scale deliverable from the outset, and then adding stretch goals if they turn out to be easier than expected, is a good way to keep your morale up and your learning visible.


## For week 3

When we get back together on September 8th, we'll be talking about GitHub, filetypes, and version control, and we'll have **two new readings** – and we'll be joined by one of the authors, Dr. Alison Langmead. There are also **downloads** that you should make sure to start early: that way, if you run into trouble, I can help you troubleshoot during [office hours](../office).

I'll also ask you to **write** a post to [a new discussion forum in response to the readings]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions/2), to give you a chance to think in writing about the readings and to seed our in-class conversation. Please remember to ground these in a short quotation from one of the texts, and to pose or respond to a question.


### Software setup
By the time we meet as a full class in week 03, please...

* **install a plain-text editor** if you don't already have one (e.g. [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
* **create a GitHub account** if you don't already have one.
    - Think about your username: it can, but need not, indicate your real name or match your other online profiles. (Pros and cons either way.)
* **install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) app** and any dependencies it recommends. (NB: This may take up to 20 minutes, depending on what prereqs you already have installed, so please don't wait until the morning of class.)
    - NB: If you get an error saying it's not an approved app from the app store, don't worry: it's safe! In this case, instead of double-clicking to open the installer, right-click and choose "Open" to give yourself permission to open it anyway.

### Ideas to think about
Please also **read**:

Holland-Minkley, and Thomas E. Lombardi, Springer International Publishing, 2017, pp. 63–85.

* Stolley, Karl. “The Lo-Fi Manifesto, v 2.0.” <em>Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy</em>, vol. 20, no. 2, Jan. 2016, <a href="https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/inventio/stolley/">https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/inventio/stolley/</a>.

* EXT for eager readers:
    - Stolley's "[README for The Lo-Fi Manifesto, v 2.0](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/inventio/stolley/readme/)"
    - Stolley's notes on his earlier draft, "[Lo-Fi Manifesto, v 1.2](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/inventio/stolley/1.2)"


### Seeding the class conversation
When you've read those texts at least once, please **write** a post to [a new discussion forum in response to the readings]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions/2). Remember to ground these in a short *quotation* from one of the texts, and to pose or respond to a *question* we can pick up and think through together in class.



See you soon!

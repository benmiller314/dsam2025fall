## Framing: Intro to workshop + peer review plan {#framing}

Welcome back to our guest mentors! And welcome, everyone, to the third day of presentations! Today is brought to you by _"and...?"_, meaning I'm especially interested in what _arguments_ you're starting to make: what have you been able to do or see that you wouldn't be able to without computers?

I'm excited to hear how it's been going, and especially for you all to hear how it's been going for everyone else.


### Peer review guidelines
Like last time, you'll each **write back to two of your classmates**. Remember, I'm NOT asking you to evaluate the success or significance of the project; rather, I'm asking you to help synthesize some _formative feedback_, oriented toward next steps, assuming that everything is still a work in progress.

For the in-class conversation, we're going to **draw each other out to find the way forward**: we'll ask questions and echo back key elements of your project with a **...?** to help you say more, to make explicit what might have been implicit. We might suggest tools, tutorials, or scholarship we think would be useful to bring in.

During all these rounds of questions and suggestions, let's trust that everyone is working to support one another, never to shut anyone down, and let's all listen and speak with that goal in mind.

<a id="first-half"></a>
## Presentations: first half

* Tunga
* Rose
* Yuqing

Each presentation should last five minutes, and I'll help you keep track of time. We should then have about 15 minutes for Q&A.



## Break (10 minutes)
We should hit the break at around 10:20 today.

<a id="second-half"></a>
## Presentations: second half

* Yanni
* Namrata



## EXT: Writing

If by some luck we have extra time at the end of class, we can use it to begin the homework: first, the survey, then the peer review letters.


## Homework for next time {#hw}

### Survey

Next week, we have no class: it's Thanksgiving week. When we get back, **the schedule calls for "People's choice"**: I've assembled about ten pre-fab options for how to prepare and what to do, but your priorities may well be different from my priorities.

One thing I know we'll do: Yuqing can't make it to our last class – now happening Tuesday, December 9, 12-4pm, in CL 202 – so we'll save a little time for him to present in the penultimate week.

<div class="panel panel-success alert alert-success">
    <div class="panel-body alert-body">
    Beyond that? I'm <strong><a href="https://forms.gle/NWpiZLN5A4VS53Hp9">taking a poll</a></strong>.
    </div>
</div>

The most straightforward option is just to declare a full-day (almost) Studio, so you can grab a little extra time and office-hour-power when you were already planning to be thinking about DSAM-y things. But we could also learn HTML, play with data refining tools, consider the social impact of digital technology, etc etc.

The sooner I hear from everyone, the sooner I'll be able to compile and share the results!


### Peer review

As before, there's also feedback for your classmates, assuming we didn't get to it in class.

You know the routine by now:

<ol class="spaced">
    <li>You've seen the presentation (though you may want to revisit it); now <strong>have a look through the public-facing version of the project</strong>. What do you notice? What do you wonder? What does it make you think of?</li>
    <li>Be a genuine and generous audience. To help your partner see their work through your eyes, <strong>summarize back to them what you see them doing, trying to do, or <em>almost</em> doing.</strong> (That last is often a good place for the author to lean into.)</li>
    <li><strong>Make connections and ask questions</strong>: this may include questions or clarifications about the process; comparisons with your own projects or others you've seen; tools, materials, or scholarship you think would be useful to bring in; and so on.</li>
</ol>

Above all, be yourselves. Being generous doesn't mean only singing praises, though by all means do so when it feels genuine! You can be generously critical, as long as you're critically generous at the same time. Demonstrate your care and investment in each other's success, knowing that there's still more to do to get there. Together.

### For next week: No class! (Digesting)

Have a wonderful holiday, whether that means a festive meal or just a week without class. : )

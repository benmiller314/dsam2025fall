# Week 14: Digesting
<span class="date">November 24, 2025</span>


## No class today!

* Homework from last time
    - [poll on what we'll do after break](https://forms.gle/NWpiZLN5A4VS53Hp9)
    - peer review letters, posted to the [forum]({{site.repo_url}}/discussions)
* Homework for next time: t.b.d. based on poll
    - I'll send an email and update the schedule page when the results are in

Have a wonderful holiday, whether that means a festive meal or just a week without class. : )

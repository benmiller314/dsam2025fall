## Framing: Intro to workshop + peer review plan {#framing}

Welcome back, and welcome to our first day of presentations! I'm excited to hear more about how it's been going, and especially for you all to hear how it's been going for everyone else.

I also want to welcome the DSAM Practicum instructors! You already know Alison Langmead; we're also joined by Aaron Brenner, from the University Libraries. Aaron, do you want to say a few words to introduce yourself?

They're here not to pass judgment on you or your projects, but rather to get to know you and your projects, so they can support you even better if you take Practicum in the spring. Now, that may sometimes mean asking probing questions about why you've chosen your method or materials – but these are genuine questions, and all of us expect you to have interesting thoughts on those things, whether you've articulated them before or not.

So let's think together into that almost-said! Let's find the balance between the heart of your interests and the minimalist approach that asks, first, what you have, so we can figure out what you really need and what you can safely let go for now. Yes?

### Peer review guidelines
About that peer review: you'll each be responsible for **writing back to two of your classmates**. In those reviews, I'm NOT asking you to evaluate the success of the project; rather, I'm asking you to help synthesize some _formative feedback_, oriented toward next steps, assuming that everything is still a work in progress.

<div class="panel panel-success alert alert-success">
<div class="panel-body alert-body">
    You may be wondering, "How am I supposed to offer feedback when I'm still figuring so much out myself?" Well, in part, by being a genuine audience for your classmates:
</div></div>

* Help them see how their work is coming across to you: **describe back to them what you see them doing, trying to do, or _almost_ doing.** (That last is often a good place to lean into.)

* **Draw them out to find the way forward.** Help your partners see the next steps by asking follow-up questions about their sources or their process; by highlighting comparisons with other projects you've seen that might be good models (or useful foils); by suggesting tools, tutorials, or scholarship you think would be useful to bring in; and so on.

* **Above all, be generous.** That doesn't mean only singing praises, though by all means do so when it feels genuine! You can be generously critical, as long as you're critically generous at the same time. Demonstrate your care and investment in each other's success, knowing that there's still more to do to get there.

<div class="alert alert-info panel panel-info">
    <div class="alert-body panel-body">
        We'll start with in-class conversation, but I'll ask everyone to also <em>write notes to two classmates</em>, which you can share as a reply to their forum post. If there's time in class, awesome! But there's a good chance this will end up being homework.
    </div>
</div>

I've split presentations in two sets of five, with peer reviews crossing from one set to the  the other. That way, you can pay extra attention to your assigned partner without having to worry that your own presentation is imminent.

<!-- ### A workshop cycle

Here's how I'd like it to work. Each person's project will get about ~~15~~ 25 minutes:

1. The first five minutes will be your **presentation** you've pre-recorded.
2. From there, the rest of us start by **saying back** the heart of the project, with a **...?** at the end, opening a space for the presenter to say more.
    - This kind of _active listening_ can often get us to the edge of our current thinking, testing out the almost-said implications of what feels right and what feels off. I can start us off after the first presentation, to demonstrate what I mean.
3. That should set up a more organic back-and-forth **conversation** about the project. Anything is fair game here: tools, materials, or scholarship you think would be useful to bring in; questions or clarifications about the process (including questions about sources, processing, or presentation platforms); comparisons with your own projects; etc.
4. At each transition between projects, take some quick private **notes**: what do you want to remember for your own future projects or presentations? for your written peer review? -->




<a id="first-half"></a>
## Presentations: first half

* Tunga
* Rose
* John

Each presentation should last five minutes, and I'll help you keep track of time. We should then have about 15 minutes for Q&A.



## Break (10 minutes)
We should hit the break at around 10:20 today.

<a id="second-half"></a>
## Presentations: second half

* Scylla
* Yuqing




<!--
<a id="peer-review"></a>
## Follow-ups to the project discussions

* If you haven't yet posted a link to a public-facing deliverable, please do so ASAP: even if it's just the text of your presentation or a folder with a CSV dataset and a README file, that will be essential for your peer reviewers – and for your own later reflection.
    - I'd be happy to help you create a GitHub repo if you'd like it. -->


## EXT: Writing

If by some luck we have extra time at the end of class, let's use it to begin your peer review letters.

<a id="hw"></a>
## Homework for next time

### Peer review

There's feedback for your classmates, if we didn't get to it in class, and there's a new topic for next week: data + people.

<ol class="spaced">
    <li>You've seen the presentation (though you may want to revisit it); now <strong>have a look through the public-facing version of the project</strong>. What do you notice? What do you wonder? What does it make you think of?</li>
    <li>Be a genuine and generous audience. To help your partner see their work through your eyes, <strong>summarize back to them what you see them doing, trying to do, or <em>almost</em> doing.</strong> (That last is often a good place for the author to lean into.)</li>
    <li><strong>Make connections and ask questions</strong>: this may include questions or clarifications about the process; comparisons with your own projects or others you've seen; tools, materials, or scholarship you think would be useful to bring in; and so on.</li>
</ol>

Above all, be yourselves. Being generous doesn't mean only singing praises, though by all means do so when it feels genuine! You can be generously critical, as long as you're critically generous at the same time. Demonstrate your care and investment in each other's success, knowing that there's still more to do to get there. Together.

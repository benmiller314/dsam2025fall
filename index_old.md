    <p id="description">The DSAM Seminar is designed to prepare students to undertake independent digital projects in scholarly or creative modes, with applications to each student's own home fields in the humanities and allied social sciences. Each week, we'll divide time between reflective discussion informed by assigned readings and hands-on practice with digital tools and platforms. In addition to smaller skill-building exercises, students will iteratively develop a more sustained project of their own choosing – with feedback from the professor and peers to help keep the scope both tractable and compelling. No prior experience in digital research is necessary.</p>
